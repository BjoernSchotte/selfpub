selfpub
=======

A small self-publishing platform for eBooks, suited for the needs of Geeks. Yes, you can use tools like Calibre (free) or Scrivener (commercial) for self-publishing, but geeks want to write their texts as plain-text in an editor they like and (co-)create books via git(hub).

It relies on pandoc and kindlegen, and to preview your kindle mobi you should use kindle previewer.
